# Configuring an Active Directory Home Lab

## Objective
This hands-on project allowed me to explore and manage Active Directory objects using the "Active Directory Users and Computers" tool. I created and managed Organizational Units (OU), users, groups, and computer objects, gaining practical experience in Active Directory administration. My main goal of this at-home lab was to become comfortable in the AD environment. I used my university's virtualized environment to do so. I skipped configuring the virtualized environment to reduce the length of this project.




### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of Active directory environment.
- Managed OUs, users and groups gaining practical experience in AD administration
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity/IT.

My first step in this project was creating an out-marketing group within AD. To do so I started by navigating to the "Active Directory users and computers" under the "tools" tab.
